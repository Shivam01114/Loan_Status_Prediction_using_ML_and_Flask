📌 Loan Status Prediction – AI-Based Financial Decision System
This repository contains a Machine Learning powered Loan Status Prediction system
that predicts loan approval outcomes using applicant data. The model is trained using 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deployed via a Flask web application with an advanced, animated UI.

🚀 Project Highlights:
SVM (Linear Kernel) model for binary classification
Class imbalance handled using balanced class weights
Feature scaling and preprocessing pipeline
Bias-controlled and fair predictions
Flask-based deployment
Interactive prediction form & result dashboard
AI workflow visualization
Modern, responsive, full-screen UI
